# Mongolia Hydrogen Powertrain Initiative 🇲🇳💧⚡

**Concept:**  
Integrating Green Hydrogen with Bosch Powertrain technologies for Mongolia’s cold climate, mining industry, transport sector and data infrastructure — while protecting water resources.

## Vision

- Replace diesel dependency in heavy transport
- Use renewable surplus for hydrogen storage
- Protect groundwater and ecosystems
- Build local engineering capacity

## Core Pillars

1. Mining Retrofit with Hydrogen Powertrain  
2. Data Center Fuel Cell Backup  
3. Intercity Hydrogen Transport  
4. Water-Safe Electrolysis  
5. Cold Climate Optimization

## Principles

- Water First Policy  
- Multistakeholder Governance  
- Open Data Monitoring  
- Safety by Design  
- Local Capacity Building

## Pilot Areas

- Mining haul trucks conversion  
- Fuel cell microgrid for data center  
- Hydrogen bus corridor  
- Agriculture machinery

## Contribution

Open for engineers, policy experts, students and communities.
